## 1. Introduction and Project Genesis

### 1.1 Background and Motivation

Traditional molecular docking workflows require installation of complex software dependencies, command-line interfaces, and significant computational resources. These barriers limit accessibility for researchers, students, and professionals without extensive computational chemistry infrastructure.

SimDock Pro was conceived to democratize molecular docking by providing:
- **Zero-installation deployment** via modern web browsers
- **Client-side computation** eliminating server costs and data privacy concerns
- **Intuitive graphical interface** reducing the learning curve for non-specialists
- **Cross-platform compatibility** across Windows, macOS, and Linux systems

### 1.2 Technical Architecture Overview

The application employs a novel architecture where traditional "backend" computational chemistry operations execute entirely within the browser:

### 1.3 Codebase Layer Separation (January 2026)

Following the principle of separation of concerns, the codebase was restructured into distinct layers:

**Core Layer (src/core/)** - WASM Engine:
- `services/` - 5 WASM service wrappers (RDKit, OpenBabel, Vina, PDB, PubChem)
- `workers/` - Background docking worker
- `utils/` - Computational utilities (gridbox, parsers)
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions

**UI Layer (src/ui/)** - React Components:
- `components/` - 15 React UI components
- `styles/` - 14 CSS files for component styling

This separation enables:
1. Independent development of computation and UI
2. Clearer code navigation and maintenance
3. Potential for core layer reuse in other projects

### 2.1 Phase I: Core Infrastructure (December 2025)

#### 2.1.1 Initial Framework Setup
- **Framework Selection:** React 18 with TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- **Build System:** Vite 7.x chosen for superior WASM handling and hot module replacement
- **State Management:** Zustand implemented for lightweight, performant global state
- **3D Visualization:** NGL Viewer integrated for molecular structure rendering

#### 2.1.2 WASM Integration Challenges

**Problem Encountered:** SharedArrayBuffer restrictions in modern browsers require specific Cross-Origin headers (COOP/COEP).

**Solution Implemented:**
```javascript
// vite.config.ts
headers: {
    'Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy': 'require-corp',
    'Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy': 'same-origin'
}
```

**Problem Encountered:** Vina WASM timeout issues during computation-intensive docking operations.

**Investigation (December 31, 2025):** Extensive debugging revealed that ligand complexity and exhaustiveness settings significantly impact browser performance. Ultra-minimal docking parameters were tested:
- Grid size: 15×15×15 Å
- Exhaustiveness: 1
- Modes: 1

**Resolution Status:** Ongoing optimization - recompiling Vina without pthreads explored as potential solution.

### 2.2 Phase II: User Interface Development (December 2025 - January 2026)

#### 2.2.1 Interface Design Philosophy

The UI design followed Apple's Human Interface Guidelines, emphasizing:
- **Spatial computing paradigm:** Floating panels over immersive 3D viewport
- **Glassmorphism effects:** Backdrop blur with subtle transparency
- **Minimal cognitive load:** Progressive disclosure of advanced options

#### 2.2.2 React Green Screen Crash (December 25-26, 2025)

**Critical Bug:** Application consistently crashed with green screen on load.

**Root Cause Analysis:**
1. `forwardRef` implementation conflicts in `Viewer.jsx`
2. Runtime errors in component mounting lifecycle
3. Build-time TypeScript errors masked by development server

**Resolution Steps:**
1. Refactored `forwardRef` usage in core components
2. Implemented `ErrorBoundary.tsx` for graceful error handling
3. Cleared Vite cache and performed clean rebuild
4. Verified build with `npm run build` before development testing

**Lessons Learned:** Always verify production build integrity before extensive development.

### 2.3 Phase III: Visual Excellence Initiative (January 2026)

#### 2.3.1 Global Theme System Implementation (January 6, 2026)

**Objective:** Implement comprehensive dual-mode (Dark/Light) theme system meeting Apple-grade polish requirements.

**Scope of Work:**
- 80+ CSS custom properties defined
- 14 CSS files refactored to use design tokens
- Smooth 250ms crossfade transitions
- WCAG AA accessibility compliance

**Design Tokens Implemented:**

| Category | Tokens | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| Backgrounds | 7 | Viewport, surfaces, modals |
| Text Hierarchy | 5 | Primary, secondary, disabled, metadata, mono |
| Molecular Viz | 12 | Atom colors, bonds, selection glow |
| Interactions | 6 | Hover, focus, active states |
| Energy Maps | 5 | Cold-to-hot gradient |
| 3D Viewport | 8 | Grid, axes, gizmos, measurements |

**Dark Mode Characteristics:**
- Background: Near-black neutral (#0A0D10)
- Accent glow effects on active elements
- Stronger shadows for depth
- Cooler scene lighting

**Light Mode Characteristics:**
- Background: Ceramic off-white (#F3F5F7)
- No glow effects (cleaner aesthetic)
- Softer shadows
- Neutral-warm lighting

**Verification:** Browser testing confirmed proper rendering in both modes with smooth transitions.

## 11. Development Session Log: January 10, 2026

### 11.1 UI/UX Improvements - Panel Scrollbars

**Issue:** The Input Parameters panel had non-functional scroll buttons (ChevronLeft/Right/Up/Down icons) that didn't properly scroll the content.

**Resolution:**
1. Removed custom scroll buttons from `DraggablePanel.tsx` - eliminated the complex button-based scrolling system
2. Replaced with native browser scrollbars styled with teal/cyan gradient to match the app theme
3. Updated `DraggablePanel.css` with:
   - `overflow-x: auto` and `overflow-y: auto` for both-direction scrolling
   - 12px scrollbar width for visibility
   - Custom `::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb` styling with gradient colors
   - Firefox support via `scrollbar-width` and `scrollbar-color`
4. Fixed conflicting styles in `App.css` that were setting `width: 100%` and `overflow: hidden` on `.input-panel`, preventing horizontal scrolling
5. Updated `InputPanel.css` with `width: max-content` and `min-width: 100%` to allow content expansion
6. Updated `DockingBoxPanel.css` with `min-width: 380px` to ensure all 3 coordinate columns (X, Y, Z) remain visible

**Result:** Both horizontal and vertical scrollbars now work correctly, allowing access to all panel content.

### 11.2 Bug Fix - Save Mission Feature

**Issue:** The Save button in the FloatingToolbar was completely unresponsive - no modal appeared, no alerts, and no console output. Later, the modal would appear but clicking "Save Log" button had no effect.

**Root Cause Analysis:** 
- The `.ui-overlay-layer` in App.css has `pointer-events: none` to allow clicks to pass through to the 3D viewer
- Several UI elements are whitelisted with `pointer-events: auto` (sidebar, panels, toolbar)
- The `.save-modal-overlay` was **NOT** in this whitelist, so clicks on the "Save Log" button were passing through to the 3D viewer instead of being captured by the button

**Resolution:**
- Added `.save-modal-overlay` to the `pointer-events: auto` selector list in `App.css` (line 42)
- This allows the modal and its buttons to receive click events

**Verification:** Browser testing confirmed the Save Log button now works correctly for both new and existing missions.

## [2026-01-10] Performance Overhaul & Responsiveness Fixes

**Issues Addressed:**
1. **Application Freezing:** Fixed a critical issue where the application froze ("Page Unresponsive") due to synchronous storage of large file contents in localStorage.
2. **Startup Delays:** Removed blocking initialization of RDKit and OpenBabel. Implemented Lazy Loading.
3. **Use as Ligand Lag:** Replaced the heavy OpenBabel WASM conversion for PubChem imports with a lightweight JavaScript fallback (sdfToPdbqt), ensuring instant responsiveness.

**Technical Changes:**
- **Storage:** Updated DockingStore (v2) to exclude eceptorFile and ligandFile content from persistence.
- **PrepPanel:** Refactored handleUsePubchemAsLigand to prioritize JS conversion.
- **MoleculeViewer:** Split useEffect to decouple model rendering from box updates.
- **UI:** Renamed "Use as Ligand" to "PROCEED TO DOCKING ?" to verify code updates.
